# WMS WebApp Migration Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step process for migrating the existing WMS WebApp to the new architecture without disrupting functionality.

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Setup New Structure

1. ✅ Create base directory structure:
   - `src/app/`
   - `src/features/`
   - `src/services/`
   - `src/hooks/`

2. ✅ Create base API client setup:
   - `src/services/api-client.ts`

3. ✅ Setup feature-based organization:
   - `src/features/auth/`
   - `src/features/dashboard/`
   - `src/features/permission-management/`

4. ✅ Create layouts for different sections:
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`
   - `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
   - `src/app/settings/layout.tsx`

### Phase 2: Migrate Authentication

1. ✅ Migrate login functionality:
   - `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx`
   - `src/app/login/page.tsx`
   - `src/services/auth.service.ts`

2. Migrate user profile functionality:
   - `src/features/auth/components/UserProfile.tsx`
   - `src/features/auth/hooks/useAuth.ts`

### Phase 3: Migrate Dashboard

1. ✅ Create dashboard services:
   - `src/services/dashboard/analytics.service.ts`
   - `src/services/dashboard/inventory.service.ts`

2. ✅ Create dashboard hooks:
   - `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useAnalytics.ts`
   - `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useInventoryAlerts.ts`

3. Migrate dashboard components:
   - `src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardSummary.tsx`
   - `src/features/dashboard/components/InventoryTrendsChart.tsx`
   - `src/features/dashboard/components/CategoryDistributionChart.tsx`
   - `src/features/dashboard/components/WarehouseSpaceChart.tsx`

### Phase 4: Migrate Permission Management

1. ✅ Define permission management types:
   - `src/features/permission-management/types/index.ts`

2. ✅ Create permission hooks:
   - `src/features/permission-management/hooks/usePermissions.ts`

3. Migrate user/role/permission components:
   - `src/features/permission-management/components/user/UserList.tsx`
   - `src/features/permission-management/components/role/RoleList.tsx`
   - `src/features/permission-management/components/permission/PermissionList.tsx`

### Phase 5: Migrate Remaining Features

1. Migrate inventory management:
   - `src/features/inventory/...`

2. Migrate receiving functionality:
   - `src/features/receiving/...`

3. Migrate request picking functionality:
   - `src/features/request-picking/...`

4. Migrate packing functionality:
   - `src/features/packing/...`

### Phase 6: Update Routes and Navigation

1. ✅ Create new App.tsx with updated routes:
   - `src/App-new.tsx`

2. Update navigation components to work with new structure:
   - `src/components/SidebarNav.tsx` (update routes)

### Phase 7: Finalization and Testing

1. Validate all functionality works as before
2. Ensure no regressions in features
3. Test with different user roles
4. Optimize performance
5. Switch to new App.tsx fully

## Advantages of New Structure

1. **Maintainability**: Code is organized by feature, making it easier to locate and modify related functionality.
2. **Scalability**: New features can be added in their own directory without affecting existing code.
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand.
4. **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting improve initial load times.
5. **Testability**: Isolated features and services are easier to test.
