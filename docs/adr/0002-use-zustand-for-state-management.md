# 2. Use Zustand for State Management

Date: 2025-04-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a state management solution that is lightweight, easy to use, and performs well.

## Decision

We will use Zustand as our primary state management solution instead of alternatives like Redux or MobX.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Minimal boilerplate
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Easy to learn and use
- Good performance with React 18
- Small bundle size

### Negative
- Less ecosystem/tooling compared to Redux
- May need additional patterns for complex state logic

## Implementation Notes

Zustand will be used for global state management alongside React Context for specific use cases like authentication and theming. This hybrid approach allows us to use the best tool for each specific state management need.
