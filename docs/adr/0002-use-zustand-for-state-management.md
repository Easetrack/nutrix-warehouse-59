# 2. Use Zustand for State Management

Date: 2025-04-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a state management solution that is lightweight, easy to use, and performs well.

## Decision

We will use Zustand as our primary state management solution instead of alternatives like Redux or MobX.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Minimal boilerplate
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Easy to learn and use
- Good performance with React 18
- Small bundle size

### Negative
- Less ecosystem/tooling compared to Redux
- May need additional patterns for complex state logic
