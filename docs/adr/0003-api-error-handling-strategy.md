# 3. API Error Handling Strategy

Date: 2025-04-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a consistent way to handle API errors across the application.

## Decision

We will implement a centralized error handling strategy using:
- Axios interceptors for global error handling
- React Query for data fetching and error management
- Toast notifications for user feedback

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent error handling across the app
- Better user experience with clear error messages
- Easier debugging and maintenance

### Negative
- Additional setup required
- Need to maintain error message consistency
